    <h1>Azhagiya Tamil Magan</h1>
    <p>"Azhagiya Tamil Magan" is a 2007 Tamil-language psychological action thriller film directed by Bharathan and starring Vijay in dual roles, along with Shriya Saran, Namitha, and N. Santhanam in key roles. The film features a unique storyline that blends action, romance, and elements of the supernatural.</p>
    <p>The story follows Guru (Vijay), a talented athlete and business management student who lives a peaceful life with his girlfriend, Abhinaya (Shriya Saran). Things take a dramatic turn when Guru starts experiencing strange, vivid visions of future events. These visions show him committing heinous acts, including harming his loved ones. Terrified by these premonitions, Guru fears that he might have a split personality or be possessed by a malevolent force.</p>
    <p>In one of his visions, Guru sees himself attempting to kill Abhinaya, which leads him to leave her and his life behind, hoping to protect her from himself. He moves to Mumbai, where he tries to stay away from everyone he cares about. Meanwhile, Abhinaya is heartbroken and confused by Guru's sudden disappearance.</p>
    <p>In Mumbai, Guru encounters a look-alike named Prasad (also played by Vijay), a ruthless and greedy man who is involved in various criminal activities. Prasad learns about Guru's visions and decides to exploit the situation to his advantage. He plans to impersonate Guru and take over his life, especially by getting close to Abhinaya, whom he desires.</p>
    <p>The film builds up to a tense climax where Guru must confront Prasad, save Abhinaya, and clear his name. The dual role played by Vijay adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, as the audience witnesses the stark contrast between the innocent and virtuous Guru and the cunning and villainous Prasad.</p>
    <p>"Azhagiya Tamil Magan" features music composed by A. R. Rahman, which was one of the highlights of the film. Although the film received mixed reviews, particularly for its complex plot, Vijay's performance in dual roles was widely appreciated. The movie has since gained a cult following among fans of Vijay and Tamil cinema.</p>

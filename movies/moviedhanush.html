His life takes a drastic turn when he is recruited by a London-based crime lord named Peter Sprott (played by James Cosmo) to help him eliminate a rival gang led by Sivadoss (played by Joju George), a Tamilian immigrant who is fighting against the exploitation of his community.</p>
    <p>As Suruli travels to London, he finds himself caught in a web of deceit, power struggles, and moral dilemmas. The film explores themes of identity, belonging, and the immigrant experience, particularly focusing on the plight of Tamil refugees.

    <h1>Thangamagan</h1>
    <p>Thanga Magan is a 2015 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by Velraj, starring Dhanush in the lead role, with Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Amy Jackson as the female leads. The film also features K. S. Ravikumar, Raadhika Sarathkumar, and Sathish in important roles.</p>
    <p>Thanga Magan follows the life of Tamizh (played by Dhanush), a happy-go-lucky young man who enjoys life with his family and friends. The story is divided into two parts: the first half is light-hearted and revolves around Tamizh's carefree days, his love life, and his close-knit relationship with his parents.</p>
    <p>Tamizh falls in love with Hema (played by Amy Jackson), but their relationship ends due to cultural differences and misunderstandings. Heartbroken, Tamizh eventually marries Yamuna (played by Samantha Ruth Prabhu), a woman chosen by his mother. Despite his initial reluctance, Tamizh grows to love and care for Yamuna.</p>
    <p>The second half of the movie takes a more serious tone as it deals with the struggles faced by Tamizh's family. His father (played by K. S. Ravikumar), who is an honest government employee, is falsely accused of embezzlement and loses his job. Unable to bear the shame, his father takes his own life. Tamizh, devastated by his father's death, sets out to clear his father's name and bring the real culprits to justice.</p>
